**Introduction:**
This is a small, standalone PHP-based Reminder App that runs on a local web server.  
It was created as a personal learning project to explore PHP, CRUD operations, and automated mailing via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

The app works out of the box on local environments like my other project, [**Webserver-Rethink**](https://github.com/Tyomus/Webserver-rethink) or can be embedded into any website.

## Features ##

- Add, edit, and delete reminders (CRUD)
- Each reminder includes: title, description, due date, notice date, and email (for the reminder to be send to).
- [**PHPMailer**](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) for the SMTP email sending
- Lightweight setup â€“ no external dependencies required beyond an SMTP provider

## Setup Guide: ##

pkg install composer
 
install PHPMailer with composer: composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
or download it from github https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer

creathe an accout by an SMTP  (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Provider like Brevo.
